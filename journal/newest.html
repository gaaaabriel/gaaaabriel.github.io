		<h2>28/03/21/18:10:46</h2>sad that i have 4 twitter accounts and keep typing messages here maybe i just want to talk to people
		 but i dont want to y'knowww; üò¨üò¨üò¨ recently (many of my aquaintances have noticed this) i became numb to everything i feel
			like no event no words no nothing is going to shake me {} i consume so much media "because it's enjoyable" but i think my goal
			 is always subconsciously social () i can't think of the last time i watched or read something without thinking about twitter
			 somehow, but this is not limited to media i think, i think i haven't done anything without having twitter interaction at the back
			 of my mind somehow.. i fell in it like many others, trying to gain skill in anything just to make myslef interesting enough
			 to get attention. if i draw it's for twitter, music it's for twitter talking eating watching studying every activity is for Twitter
		 i guess the reason i went numb to everything is that i like, exited myself to become my twitter, i am dirtfolder now. i spend hours a day
	 just looking at my profile, looking at my followings the people that follow me, why did they do that? how am i interesting? what do i have to develop
 to be more intersting? do the people want this? i try to catter to an audience now, im planning im categorizing, who would like that? is this what *** is
intersted in? looking at touhou wiki rewatching cookie's fortune for the 4th time today in the end maybe im not doing it for fun, im just crunching the numbers
to get more related to people. ok so since nobody is gonna read this anyways (especially those who are concerned, except one or two maybe), here is the little chart i
made to explain the media and stuff [chart removed for numerous reasons] it actually took a long time so i dont
remember what i was talking about... it probably wasnt important but cringe so im not gna re read the paragraphe ctrl s fetch'n'pull nvr gonna think abt this again</div>

		<h2>26/03/21/02:19:26</h2> actually, now that i think about they are some people that are just.. people, that don‚Äôt need the contrast to feel human (human as in the quality, not that everybody else feels like an alien) i can think of a really good example (talking about twitter obvi i don‚Äôt have anything else)  but i don‚Äôt wanna namedrop people i don‚Äôt know even if it‚Äôs to say they‚Äôre nice and i care for them very much

		<div class="entry" id="tkmiz">
		<h2>25/03/21/23:53:00</h2>  and like, tkmiz.. man.. it's unbelievable.. artist, especially good ones, have always been strange to think about, but them especially..
		how profoundly sad someone must be to make something so soothing as glt & shim.sim. they almost don't feel real anymore, but  <a href="http://img.saraba1st.com/forum/201710/23/172803ocgw4lla41b5wefw.jpg"	target="popup"
		 onclick="window.open('http://img.saraba1st.com/forum/201710/23/172803ocgw4lla41b5wefw.jpg','popup','width=400,height=400'); return false;">their background</a>, this contrast is so apparent so breaking,
		how poetic can [h-word] be? i wonder. maybe this immorality is what makes everybody human? it's amazing how this faceless nameless genderless identity led to
		one of the most human person ever. it's a talk about love, maybe. i dont think the oneshot changed my vision on shijima particulary (i don't think they meant it to be canon), but it says a lot about
		the author i think. im too young to talk about this [minor], especially in public. if i had to make a thesis on someone, i think it would be them (plus the rietveld likes gross stuff don't they), or me, idk.
		it's so weird to think about, how they're living (i could say this about a lot of people), and like still this contrast, i was trying to articulate how the most profound people are speaking from the hole
		(not a reference to the manga), they've seen it all in some sense, and i guess for tkmiz, they did it all too. maybe it's a more primal talk then love, maybe it's just loneliness, the "self" being stuck in that weird line,
		not feeling real (itself and from the outside too), so nobody can reach. this is such a weird thing to talk about, because you wouldn't talk about it with anybody, i can't even make the thoughts real for myself, but if i
		could i wouldn't share them because just saying "oh tkmiz got me thinking about how poetic [h-word] actually is", c'mon, nobody wants to here that. i guess a philosopher or an author's job is to make people wanna hear
		that, but im not any of them, but also they wouldn't speak about it themselves because as i said (maybe this is only tkmiz, i just don't know of any ppl able to make something quite as "profound" ( i hate that word) as them) they're
		speaking from the hole, so it isn't as "profound" any more, it's just sadly (maybe even pitifully, or creepily) complentative. i don't know what those  <a href="http://img.saraba1st.com/forum/201710/23/172803ocgw4lla41b5wefw.jpg"	target="popup"
		 onclick="window.open('http://img.saraba1st.com/forum/201710/23/172803ocgw4lla41b5wefw.jpg','popup','width=400,height=400'); return false;">2014</a> tweets say but if i could read them i bet i would just sigh or maybe cringe a little.
		this is repeating myself but that's the contrast im talking about a person can be so human, their thoughts so senseful, but if it's turning around the whole H thing it becomes dillusional, idk if that's like a "convention of society" has we
		say in school or like something in human nature, i think it's the second because that contrast is greater than most of the things the "conventions" make feel when their unruled. im not saying the  <a href="http://img.saraba1st.com/forum/201710/23/172803ocgw4lla41b5wefw.jpg"	target="popup"
		 onclick="window.open('http://img.saraba1st.com/forum/201710/23/172803ocgw4lla41b5wefw.jpg','popup','width=400,height=400'); return false;">2014</a> tweets were bad and they should never have
		made them, otherwise the whole "speaking from the hole" thing wouldn't be happening blah blaah blah you get it. tkmiz just seems like this entity this concept defined by their contrast between their work and their emotions, the modern art and the [h-word],
		that makes them some sort of the perfect representation of today's artist, maybe today's person, or even a point that could be given has humanity's hypothetical representation, but maybe tkmiz is just someone, in the end.
